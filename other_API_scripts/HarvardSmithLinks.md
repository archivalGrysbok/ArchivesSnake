# ASpaceUtils
## Description
This set of scripts is comprised of a very partial API client ([link](https://github.com/smith-special-collections/aspace-utils/blob/smith/shared.rb)),
an analysis script for the logs emitted by this client ([link](https://github.com/smith-special-collections/aspace-utils/blob/smith/analyze_logs.rb)),
and several ingest scripts making use of the client.  Limited documentation is provided in the github readme.
